# tts-wargaming-model-script

A script to use on models in wargaming. It is a collection of features from elsewhere (primarily stolen from Yellowscribe).

Usage of the updater python script:

1. Install Python if you haven't already.
2. Download this repo to your computer somewhere.
3. Drag a save file or save folder onto `tts_wargaming_model_script_updater.py`. You should see a window with text in it, it should work for a while, then tell you to press enter to exit.
